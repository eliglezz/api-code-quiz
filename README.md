# api-code-quiz
Another homework assignment, the goal was to have a short quiz that punished a user for getting an incorrect answer, have a countdown timer, allowed the user to add their score to the page using local storage, had button to start, and provide multiple questions. All this had to be achieved with JavaScript. The code consist of a list of buttons showing when pressing start, going into functions to keep the next questions. Event listeners were added to pick up button clicks. I found this challenging and not sure it works correctly yet.
